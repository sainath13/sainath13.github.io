-  Owner of client-side C++ and JAVA API (used to connect to Order and Quote Management system- Agora). Accomplished migration of over 300 client applications across from slower FIX tag-based protocol to new Hermes binary serialization protocol.
- Implemented core changes in the order management system like designing data types to improve precision and accuracy of average price calculations, integrating changes in binary serialization, making distributed components recoverable and fault-tolerant.
- Managed quarterly production releases of Hermes API flavors in C++, Java, and C#, mediated API side functional requirements, and acted as technical support for client queries related to API functionality, usage, and connection to OMS Agora and its TProxy components.
- Developed a distributed monitoring and deployment framework “AgoraMon” in Python for performing pre-trade application health checks on distributed server infrastructure and managing deployments which reduced the monitoring cost by 70,000 USD per quarter.
- Streamlined client-side UAT Testing by developing a web app in ReactJS with backend in NodeJS for easily accessing UAT trades data by providing OrderID and client team names.
- Maintained tools that selectively inserts “Good till Cancel” orders back into the OMS (TifSweep) and places cross-regional orders (AgoraToAgora- A2A), copies transaction logs data to MongoDB in near real-time.
- Recruited, mentored, and managed a team of two developers who worked on Hermes library and later on transferred ownership of API.
